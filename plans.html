        <div style="font-size:large; font-style: oblique; max-width:max-content; margin-top: 5px;">
            <p>
                As a career, I want to be involved with technology. Perhaps as a front-end web developer as it seems stable for me.
                I find satisfaction in seeing my work be able to be processed and show up like how I want it.
                I enjoy being able to code as it's something that I can understand well and can enjoy which is what I want in a job.
                It also pays well which is a priority for me since I got to take care of my parents.
                However I do prioritize my own happiness.

                I wouldn't mind becoming a mobile app creator--specifically a story game mobile app creator.
                I think it would be an interesting thing to create and use as a way to show my love for storytelling.
                Storytelling became a passion of mine which I want to incorporate into my work to make things enjoyable.
                I also have wanted to create games in the past as a child so I think it would be nice. 
                However, I will start off as I understand that I have to work my way up if I want to join a company to create apps for them.

            <p>
                For college, I plan to go to San Jose State University to save money and stay close to home. I prefer knowing where I am so I'm not too keen on going to a different city for college.
                I also do want to do something that involves tech, perhaps computer science or a technology major in geology since I do like science as well. I care about our Earth so I think I could try
                making stuff like websites to help promote climate control and stuff. Overall, I just want to be close to home, get a job and get my degree. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If I don't make it into computer science or anything in technology, I will do business. My father is a businessman, my paternal grandfather was one before him too and so on.
                I think with my personality, I can make it but it wouldn't be something I'm passionate about. However, it's a stable field which is something that is a priority for me.
                Once I get that degree, I'm finding a job.
