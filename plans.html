        <p>
            As a career, I want to be involved with technology. Perhaps as a front-end web developer as it seems stable for me.
            I find satisfaction in seeing my work be able to be processed and show up like how I want it.
            I enjoy being able to code as it's something that I can understand well and can enjoy which is what I want in a job.
            It also pays well which is a priority for me since I got to take care of my parents.
            However I do prioritize my own happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wouldn't mind becoming a mobile app creator--specifically a story game mobile app creator.
            I think it would be an interesting thing to create and use as a way to show my love for storytelling.
            Storytelling became a passion of mine which I want to incorporate into my work to make things enjoyable.
            I also have wanted to create games in the past as a child so I think it would be nice. 
            However, I will start off as I understand that I have to work my way up if I want to join a company to create apps for them.
